                    I'm <b>Parikshit Jaiswal</b>, the guy behind this website. I'm an
                    <h>Indian</h> who's been traveling the world full time for 8 years
                    now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started this travel blog in 2019 to document my own international
                    trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel the
                    world and find some really good spots off the beaten path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently based in <h>Bali, Indonesia</h>, where I met my wife
                    Intan, who’s a <h>Bali </h>local. Now she joins me on these wild and
                    crazy adventures too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, climbed active
                    volcanoes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular
                    castles, temples, and monuments around the world.
